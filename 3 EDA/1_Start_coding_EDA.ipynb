The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which can be one of three classes: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.\n","\n","We will load the dataset from the internet and explore its structure and content."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Load the Iris dataset from the internet\n","import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n","\n","# Load the dataset\n","iris = load_iris()\n","iris_df = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)\n","iris_df['species'] = iris.target\n","\n","# Display the first few rows of the dataset\n","iris_df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Practical Implementation\n","We will start by loading the dataset and inspecting its structure.
